# cross_obs



`cross_obs` is the driver program for cross-scan observation at Nanshan Radio Telescope (NSRT) in Uruqmi. The program provides user-friendly GUI, replacing the previously used command line tool `controlTK`.  Most of the infrastructures are updated from the continuum observing program written by Peter Mueller from MPIfR.
